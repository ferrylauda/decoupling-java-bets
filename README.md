# Exercise: Decoupling (Java)

- Execute the tests - some of them will fail - find the root cause
- Fix the root cause by applying the dependency inversion principle
- Discuss alternative variants

### Hints

- If you want to try using a mock framework, have a look into Mockito. A dependency has already been added to the pom.xml, so you can use it right away. The documentation can be found here: http://mockito.org/
